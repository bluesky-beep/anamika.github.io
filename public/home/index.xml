      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Anamika Welcome to my personal page! Afters months of procrastination, I finally decided to make this page. The site is built using Hugo and is currently hosted on GitHub. I plan to gradually upload some important notes and personal projects here. Right now, Iâ€™m based in Japan and in the final year of my PhD at the Climate Change System Research Institute, University of Tokyo. As I navigate this transition phase and explore what comes next, this space will serve as a place to document and share my journey, thoughts, and work.</description>
