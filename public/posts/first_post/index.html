<p>This space is created to keep a track of everything I&rsquo;m interested in and have worked on such as past projects, ongoing ideas, and topics that don&rsquo;t fit any where else (yet). It is a personal archive, a learning log and hopefully to connect with others who are exploring similar questions. Some of the projects I&rsquo;ve worked especially during my PhD migt be useful to others working on enviornmental data, satellite imagery, or spatial modeling.</p>
<p>This place for also for stories, recipes, and travel. I love traveling, especially the kind that lets you learn about people  their habits, languages, mistakes, and food. I read often, but more than books, I’ve learned the most from conversations sometimes intense, sometimes spontaneous, and often over tea or food. Which brings me to another small passion: &ldquo;Vegetarian food experiments&rdquo;. I like blending cuisines, improvising with local ingredients, and reproducing familiar recipes with unexpected twists. You&rsquo;ll probably find a few of those here too. Especially since I grew up in vegeterian household, I hope to help anyone who wants to pivot for plant based food habits while appreciating flavours and local ingredients.</p>
<p>And of course, there will be maps. I have a real fondness for maps, data, and the tools that help us make sense of our changing world. As I try to advance my skills in geospatial technologies from remote sensing to spatial modeling and AI integration I’ll be keeping a running blog of my learning process.</p>
<p>Finally, I like to make a collectin of sunrise and sunset pictures so I will also be sharing some here as well. Capturing the sunset is an art and still trying to work on that one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile enjoy the majestic Fuji-san (Mt Fuji, Japan) captured from my balcony.
Both of these are captured sometime in January this year.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
