      <description>This space is created to keep a track of everything I&amp;rsquo;m interested in and have worked on such as past projects, ongoing ideas, and topics that don&amp;rsquo;t fit any where else (yet). It is a personal archive, a learning log and hopefully to connect with others who are exploring similar questions. Some of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked especially during my PhD migt be useful to others working on enviornmental data, satellite imagery, or spatial modeling.</description>
