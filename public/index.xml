      <description>This space is created to keep a track of everything I&amp;rsquo;m interested in and have worked on such as past projects, ongoing ideas, and topics that don&amp;rsquo;t fit any where else (yet). It is a personal archive, a learning log and hopefully to connect with others who are exploring similar questions. Some of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked especially during my PhD migt be useful to others working on enviornmental data, satellite imagery, or spatial modeling.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Anamika Welcome to this page!&#xA;Afters months of procrastination, I finally got around to building and deploying this site. The site is built using Hugo and is currently hosted on GitHub. I plan to gradually upload some important notes and personal projects here. Right now, Iâ€™m based in Japan and in the final year of my PhD at the Climate Change System Research Institute, The University of Tokyo.</description>
