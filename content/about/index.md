## Hi, I'm Anamika
> Welcome to this page!

Afters months of procrastination, I finally got around to building and deploying this site. The site is built using Hugo and is currently hosted on GitHub. 
I plan to gradually upload some important notes and personal projects here.
Right now, I’m based in Japan and in the final year of my PhD at the Climate Change System Research Institute, The University of Tokyo. As I navigate this transition phase and explore what comes next, this space will serve as a place to document and share my journey, thoughts, and work.
I believe that learning should be a phenomenal experience and not a mechanical one. I enjoy exploring things at my own pace, often discovering new ways to view the seemingly simple. I like  to understand how our climate is evolving and how we can better observe and interpret those changes.

Most of my work is in geospatial and remote sensing, with a growing interest for using AI in spatial experiments. It’s a fun (and sometimes chaotic) mix of maps, data, and a lot of figuring things out as I go.
