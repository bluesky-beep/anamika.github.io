This space is created to keep a track of everything I'm interested in and have worked on such as past projects, ongoing ideas, and topics that don't fit any where else (yet). It is a personal archive, a learning log and hopefully to connect with others who are exploring similar questions. Some of the projects I've worked especially during my PhD might be useful to others working on enviornmental data, satellite imagery, or spatial modeling. 


This place for also for stories, recipes, and travel. I love traveling, especially the kind that lets you learn about people  their habits, languages, mistakes, and food. I read often, but more than books, I’ve learned the most from conversations sometimes intense, sometimes spontaneous, and often over tea or food. Which brings me to another small passion: "Vegetarian food experiments". I like blending cuisines, improvising with local ingredients, and reproducing familiar recipes with unexpected twists. You'll probably find a few of those here too. Especially since I grew up in vegeterian household, I hope to help anyone who wants to pivot for plant based food habits while appreciating flavours and local ingredients. 

And of course, there will be maps. I have a real fondness for maps, data, and the tools that help us make sense of our changing world. As I try to advance my skills in geospatial technologies from remote sensing to spatial modeling and AI integration I’ll be keeping a running blog of my learning process. 

Finally, I like to make a collection of sunrise and sunset pictures so I will also be sharing some here as well.   


Meanwhile enjoy the majestic Fuji-san (Mt Fuji, Japan) captured from my balcony. 
Both of these are captured sometime in January this year.

 Stay tuned!
